        </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT
start?&nbsp;</b>
          <br>My initial interest in IT began when I took up Information
Processes and Technology (IPT) in high school for my HSC. Having completed the course,
I gained a good working knowledge of the following:&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->essential data, information, and system concepts&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->current and upcoming information technologies&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->the interactive nature of effective
information-based systems&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->the social and ethical implications of using
information technology&nbsp;<br>However, my main interest in IT came from seeing SaaS (software
as a service) start-ups succeed, and from my own personal ventures of
programming such products.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your
interest?&nbsp;</b>
          <br>A lot of my friends chose IPT for their HSC which introduced
me to the field. In high school a few of my friends produced small SaaS products
that were able to give them an income throughout the HSC years. This intrigued
me and made me interested in how they came to program such products. They were
able to teach me some basic skills which helped me on my own IT journey. I have
basic experience in programming using Python and C++. I also have some experience
with using Git and GitHub.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?&nbsp;</b>
          <br>RMIT offered a comprehensive two-way course which focused both
on IT and programming – fields that I wanted to expand my knowledge on. This
course will enable me to enter a more advanced field of study, one where I can specialise
in other programming languages and machine learning.&nbsp;<b>
            <br>
            <br>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b>&nbsp;<br>I expect to gain a more comprehensive knowledge of various
ICT components and the business aspects of IT. I also am excited to develop a
prototype of a products/service.&nbsp;

            </p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> My ideal job in the field of IT would be a mobile app developer
responsible for creating applications that make life easier. I have always been
interested in becoming an iOS developer due to the high starting salary, career
flexibility, and the fact that you can work from anywhere. The iOS developer
position at Servian Pty Ltd appealed to me due to my programming background and
the fact that I will be building cutting edge software. In addition to mobile development,
I will also be working on projects involving multiple technologies from Big
Data and Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DevOps as
well as numerous cloud technologies where I can learn, contribute and extend my
career into these technologies. The role at Servian also seems like it will be
a collaborative environment which I view as appealing.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The skills, qualifications, and experience required for the
position at Servian are listed below: <!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Working knowledge of Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, and
Flow Git.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Experience with DevOps for mobile CI/CD.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Write well-thought-out, dependable code.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->MVC and MVVM Design Patterns are well-understood.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Contribute to the development of new ideas,
analyses, designs, critiques, and improvements.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Ability to create code components that can be reused.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Keep up to speed with the newest iOS and Android
capabilities and features.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Assist in the dissemination of information and
experience across the team and the company.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Scrum Master and/or SAFe methodology experience.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Has a thorough understanding of all areas of a
mobile application's consumer experience, including UX, performance, networking,
usage data, and crash reporting.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>However, the skills, qualifications, and experience listed
above are just the benchmark requirements for the position. To ensure that I
have a good chance of getting the position I may even need to have mobile
development skills for both iOS (with Swift and/or Objective C) and Android (with
Kotlin/Java).&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The skills, qualifications, and experience I currently have are
listed below:&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Limited experience with Git and GitHub.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Basic programming experience in Python as well
as C++ from high school and RMIT.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Skills in creating wireframes, prototypes, and
screen designs for web designs and mobile apps – using Adobe XD.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->An extensive knowledge of Information Processes and
Technology (IPT) from high school.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>In order to progress and obtain the various skills,
qualifications, and experience required for the position I will need to begin learning
how to program in Swift and Objective C. Also, by
completing the RMIT IT course I will gain a foundation knowledge of contemporary
IT areas, software, applications, and job skills required to enter the IT
market. Once I learn the fundamentals of iOS development, I will need to begin
creating my own projects to develop my iOS development skills and expand my
portfolio (to showcase my work to Servian). I will also need to have skills in
spatial reasoning and design guidelines.&nbsp;

              </span>
              <br>
              <br>My results for the Myers-Briggs test suggest that I am a ‘Commander’
- someone with the extraverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging personality
traits. A Commander is a decisive person that loves momentum and accomplishment.
They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate
for long before acting on them.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Strengths:&nbsp;<br>- Efficient&nbsp;<br>- Energetic&nbsp;<br>- Self-Confident&nbsp;<br>- Strong-Willed&nbsp;<br>- Strategic Thinkers&nbsp;<br>-
  Charismatic and Inspiring&nbsp;<br>

  Impatient&nbsp;<br>-
  Arrogant&nbsp;<br>-
  Poor Handling of Emotions&nbsp;<br>-
  Cold and Ruthless&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Even though I do believe my personality type matches that of
a commander, I don’t believe I’m impatient, arrogant, and can’t control my
emotions. In fact, I believe I’m a very patient person who prefers to slow down
and assess things at work. In a team situation the test suggests that I am a natural
born leader and am suited for a job in executive positions and
entrepreneurialism. It also went on to detail how commanders are sociable and
greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming
sessions - which I believe applies to me. I believe the Myers-Briggs test
results are quite valid and is effective in defining my personality type.&nbsp;<br>

                <br>
              </span>My results
from the Matrix Education test state that I have a logical learning style - preferring
to use logic, reasoning and systems to learn new material. In turn, I like to prepare
material that needs to be memorised, as well as search for connections/patterns.
I prefer to study alone when memorising key concepts but work as a team for
productivity. I believe that the Matrix Education test is valid in discerning my
learning style.&nbsp;<br>

              </span><i>&nbsp;</i>I completed the Test My Creativity test (<a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">http://www.testmycreativity.com/</a>)
to find that I had a high creativity score of 87.6 with the average result being
63.35. The test stated that I have a desire to chance or improve things that
everyone else accepts as a norm.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <span class="u-text-palette-2-base">What do the results of these tests mean for you?&nbsp;</span>
              <br>The three tests that I have completed gave me an insight
into my unique personality, learning style, and creativity. The most applicable
test result that applied to me would be the Myers-Briggs test which showed how
I was a leader and preferred to be in a collaborative group setting.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <span class="u-text-palette-2-base">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour
in a team?&nbsp;</span>
              <br>Understanding my personality to be bold and confident I
would definitely strive to be a leader and organise a productive team. I
consider myself to lead by example in most cases. The creatively test increased
my confidence in my creative thinking process – something that is essential in
a team setting.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <span class="u-text-palette-2-base">How should you take this into account when forming a team?&nbsp;</span>
              <br>When forming a team, I need to understand myself and, also,
each group members value. Also, its important to make a collaborative environment
where every group member is valued and has input into each discussion.&nbsp;

              </span>
              <br>I intend on developing a smartphone app titled i-Job that
will feature a platform to connect job seekers directly with the individual
advertising a job/task. The app will feature a location-based interface design that
sets pins in the exact places a job is being advertised. The individual
advertising the job/task will prefer to use this app due to its easy-to-use
design as well as the fact that they can sit back and wait for a job offer. A
wide range of job types can be filtered by users from tradesmen through to delivery
drivers. I aim to develop this app for both iOS and android devices using Swift,
Objective C, Java, C++, etc. Its important to note that there are two app
variations the employer app and the worker app.&nbsp;

              </span>
              <br>i-Job ensures that people struggling to find work can always
earn money by requesting and then completing available jobs/tasks near them. It
also ensures people wanting a job to be completed don’t need to scroll through the
web to find someone viable. The app targets both unemployed individuals seeking
work and people having trouble finding someone to do their job. The current
unemployment rate in Australia is 4.2% which is a relatively big market of people
seeking work. i-Job is a free to use and easily accessible software solution.&nbsp;

              <br>
              <br>In order for the app to work effectively there will need to
be two interfaces - the employer app and the worker app.&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</b>
              <br>
              <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Employer App</b>&nbsp;<br>
              </span>An employer app is necessary for employers to advertise
their job, receive job notifications, message workers directly, and track
whether the worker is at the job location.&nbsp;<br>
              <br><i>The employer app must have the following features:</i><!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->REGISTRATION AND PROFILE MANAGEMENT: By providing
a drivers licence as well as other information we can ensure the employer is
above the&nbsp; age of 18. Also, this feature ensures the employer’s personal
information is safety stored in the case of a work-related incident.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->GEOLOCATION: Direct access to Google Maps through the app to get a bird's-eye view of
where the employee is and to see if he/she is at the job site.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MESSAGING: To&nbsp;communicate with the worker and settle where the job is
to be complete.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;REQUESTING INTERFACE: As multiple people may request
a certain job the employer can select the best worker based on their user rating
and previous experience.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->RATINGS &amp; REVIEWS: Providing
feedback and rate the worker. Also, there may be an option to view the workers
employer history and past jobs. <!--[if !supportLists]-->-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->PAYMENT METHOD INTERGRATION: To pay
the worker when the job/task is complete.&nbsp;<br>
              <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Worker App</span></b>&nbsp;<br>A worker app for workers is an important platform through
which workers can view all of the jobs/tasks near them and request to complete
the job with no hassles.&nbsp;<br>
              <br><i>The worker app must have:</i><!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->REGISTRATION AND PROFILE MANAGEMENT: Like the
employer app this ensures both parties are protected in the case of an incident.
Furthermore, the feature of an active profile which displays the workers rating
and history is essential for the employer to see.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->GEOLOCATION: Direct access to Google Maps
through the app to get a bird’s-eye view of the jobs/tasks being advertised and
to see whether they are nearby.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->MESSAGING: To communicate with the employer
directly and ask any questions regarding job requirements.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->REQUESTING INTERFACE: The
worker can request a job that suits them.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->LIVE JOB TRACKING: Real
time tracking of job offers.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
              <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->PAYMENT METHOD INTERGRATION: To
ensure the worker gets paid at the end of a job.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>As part of the development process, mobile user interface design
is also necessary for the construction of the i-Job app. The i-Job app should
offer a user-friendly interface and be responsive. Customers expect a
consistent experience in which they know exactly what to do with the app, which
buttons to press, and so on. Also, relating to the user interface i-Job will
need to be aesthetically pleasing and look professional – this can be achieved
through eye-grabbing colour schemes, high resolution photos, etc. Because flexibility
is key in mobile app development i-Job will be available on both iOS and Android,
and as such will need to be edited for many different screen sizes and resolutions.
Internet security is an ever-increasing issue - because i-Job will be storing
personal and sensitive information (e.g., credit and debit card details) the
app will need to be very secure. Furthermore, it is important that I include a
feedback system for users to report bugs, suggest new features, or provide
criticism. To make the initial experience of using the app easy I will provide “how-to”
screens to provide information on how to use different features.&nbsp;

              <br>
              <br>Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with
your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your
computer's hard drive. In the prototyping stage of my i-Job app development I
will be using Adobe XD to create screen designs and interactions for an enhanced
user experience.
To develop i-Job as an iOS app I will need a Mac computer
running the latest version of Xcode. Xcode is Apple’s Integrated Development Environment
for both Mac and iOS apps. This step will also require me to thoroughly learn Swift
and Objective C. 
Also, I will need to learn Java and C++ in order to code the
Android app. The minimum hardware requirements for Android Studio are listed
below: <!--[if !supportLists]-->

              <br>After the app has been created, I will also need good business
skills and to be able to work with teams as well as clients. Because the app
contains many features and is fairly complex it may cost over $30’000 to
produce. I will need to enter into a few courses to gain the necessary
programming skills which may also cost a substantial amount of money. However,
the hardware and software required to create the project shouldn’t cost that
much. There may also be times throughout the production process when I need to
outsource other app developers.&nbsp;

              </span>
              <br>If i-Job is created the app will help a lot of people find
work in these difficult times and will provide an effective marketing platform
for people advertising jobs/tasks. The app will help to increase employment
rates particularly in metropolitan areas. It’s easy to use design enables uses
to quickly pick up some extra money serving someone else. Despite all of the
position impacts the app has there may be unseen consequences from people
relying on the app for employment - as apps can often crash and be hacked.&nbsp;
